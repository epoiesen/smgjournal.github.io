Epoiesen DOI:xxxx This piece is a response to Reinhard&#x2019;s Publish and Perish Academic publishing &#x2026; what can be said of it? Before opening the floodgates, let&#x2019;s just agree that the process of publishing an academic work involves many peculiarities that can mystify first time authors. Andrew Reinhard&#x2019;s &#x201C;Publish and Perish&#x201D; is a choice-based interactive text designed to help newcomers to the academic publishing process, a constituency R. often finds himself explaining these concepts to. Sometimes a good topic elevates a game; sometimes a game elevates a topic. The latter should be the case here. The process of publishing involves choices, sometimes frustration, and &#x2026; &#x2026; &#x2026; a great deal of waiting. There is a worthy existentialist philosophical point here, too, encapsulated in R.&#x2019;s overview. &#x201C;Published or not, we all die&#x201D; and when we publish academic works, &#x201C;we&#x2019;re really doing this to promote ourselves, to advance our careers, and to consolidate a lifetime of work for future validation that what we did actually meant something.&#x201D;In any event, R. sets out to offer an interactive experience of the process for new authors and chooses Twine, the best tool in the business for choice-based interactive He notes that games &#x201C;are really about validation&#x201D; and that perhaps a player will gain a sense of that too. So, a realistic journey through the academic publishing process, with perhaps some validation, and a statement about the inevitability of our demise are R.&#x2019;s main points &#x2013; not for the weak of spirit. How does it play?Full disclaimer: I have never worked in a publish-or-perish setting. I ultimate chose to teach high school history after my Ph.D. I have published a pair of academic books, the first from a dissertation, and onto my third trade press book. I have also published several peer reviewed journal articles. But, happily for me, my job has never depended on my successful publishing. Still, where I lack the pit of panic in the stomach that I understand accompanies the publish-or-perish process, I know well the desire to be relevant, to have one&#x2019;s ideas be thought important and worthy of lasting, and I do have some experience in the academic publishing process.On to my playthrough:The game begins at an end that is also a beginning: I have finished the manuscript and now must decide how best to secure its future. Share it online? Keep the work to yourself? Send the text to a publisher? I thought of my dissertation-turned-book. I thought of my second book, the teacher&#x2019;s guide that I also wanted published by a reputable press. I thought of my journal articles. All of these suggested publish, publish, publish; get it in print, following how I had been raised on an academic farm (or, if you prefer, reared in an academic nursery; I meant no disparagement either way). I also thought of work that I had shared online on website and how easy and often satisfying that can be, though out in the wild like that it is often hard to tell what difference your work makes.Well, this game is called Publish and Perish after all; let&#x2019;s give it a whirl. I send it off to a publisher. Ah, but what kind of publisher, an academic press or a pay-to-publish press? I wonder how the psychological boost of getting something printed on paper can be measured. But I&#x2019;m committed. In real life I chose not to pursue the professional academic path. But this is a game; here I&#x2019;m the master of my academic destiny. Bring it on, game! Yeah! I&#x2019;m going to submit to an academic press! But the decisions don&#x2019;t end! They just don&#x2019;t end. Come on, I just want my book to get published and my lasting fame to begin. Choose large or small publishers, follow the house style guidelines or not. And the waiting &#x2026; all those choices add up to a significant delay experienced vicariously in-game. I chuckled at first, appreciating the game-mimics-life approach R. has adopted. But then I had to wait some more and while it takes fractions of minutes, not minutes or hours to click through choices, the wait isn&#x2019;t that long. But it sure feels like it. And this is the power of a choice-based text for this type of work. No number of times being told &#x201C;expect delays in publishing&#x201D; can generate the inner turmoil and impatience that a virtual publishing experience can make.If you should navigate the perils successfully and wait, and fight your inner demons and stay the course, you too can get published! If you don&#x2019;t, you can&#x2019;t. Either way, as R. promises, you will die. Like a dystopic-youth-novel-turned-movie, there are so many ways to die and most are amusing. I&#x2019;ll only note that I did not expect the demirgorgon, but then who really does?So after a number of playthroughs I did a mental checklist to reflect on R.&#x2019;s medium and the message.+ I understood R.&#x2019;s point and learned some details I had not considered or since forgotten.+ It held true to the academic process as I understand it+ I was engaged in the process far more than I would have been in a straight text or talk about the process.+ The experience was entertaining, far more entertaining than the actual process. That could be a bad thing, I suppose, a break between game and reality, but R. is clearly trying to immerse and explain, not bludgeon the author-player. The tone is light and amusing and ultimately effective.So really, R. has made an excellent choice of medium for this message, changing a potentially dry lecture topic into an interactive exploration, a more immersive experience, thereby increasing the recipient&#x2019;s stake in the process by putting them in the game. In doing so, he provides a useful little tool to introduce the process and, quite likely, spark debate and discussion among players about the veracity of the game experience and the problems of the academic publishing process. As a general rule from my experiences using games in classrooms for years, the discussion of how the game matches or does not match with reality is the supreme thinking and learning exercise for a game-based lesson. The real world practicality of the topic for its intended audience, encourages, begs for player questioning. And where players have questions they can readily engage in discussions, with Reinhard, with workshop-mates, should they play in a workshop, with each other online, and so on. These are all very good things that should help R. with his original problem of explanation.Just a final thought. Choice-based text systems offer a great opportunity to leverage the interactivity inherent in so many human endeavors, creating more engaging, though still seriously intended, didactic models. Publish and Perish is template for how a real-world process might effectively modeled as an interactive experience using choice-based text and welcome for that.I&#x2019;d like to see more of these interactive text guides, and it&#x2019;s great that Reinhard has pointed the way. The more examples of this we create, the more we can, hopefully, move others to create. On with interactivity!","tags":"interactive-fiction"},{"title":"Publish and Perish","url":"/2017/05/04/publish-and-perish/","text":"&#x261E; Publish and PerishAndrew ReinhardReceived 2017-05-04Citation: Reinhard, Andrew. 2017 &#x201C;Publish and Perish&#x201D;. Epoiesen DOI:xxxx My first Twine game is called Publish and Perish. As an academic/scholarly publisher for the American Numismatic Society (and before for the American School of Classical Studies at Athens), I frequently found myself explaining how the publishing process works (and doesn&#x2019;t) to new authors. These discussions inspired me to create a game about the peer-review and publishing process, specifically for academic non-fiction. The old &#x201C;publish or perish&#x201D; adage still stands, and professors and tenure-track hopefuls are often held to an unrealistic publishing standard of both quantity and quality. I wanted the game (interactive fiction, really) to do a couple of things: 1) walk players through the publishing cycle, being as realistic as possible, and 2) make the player perish no matter what while having a fun (or frustrating) time doing it. That&#x2019;s life, isn&#x2019;t it? Published or not, we all die. We can choose to be either amused or frustrated by this eventuality of being forgotten whether or not we created anything. We publish for the work, but mostly we publish for ourselves. Academic publication is, at its core, fundamentally about enlightened self-interest. Sure the research gets out there more or less, but we&#x2019;re really doing this to promote ourselves, to advance our careers, and to consolidate a lifetime of work for future validation that what we did actually meant something. At the 2017 TriBeCa Games Festival, Jonathan Morin of Ubisoft stated that games are really about validation. Many of us don&#x2019;t get the validation we need in the real world, but games are quite good about making a player feel accomplished. Perhaps Publish and Perish will give players some validation. Being published certainly does, and it&#x2019;s a great feeling when it happens.

Truth &amp; Beauty bombs. I built my first site in 2002 (now dead, but resurrected as https://juliettestreet.wordpress.com ) &amp; spent 15 years experimenting w/ #archaeology online. I&#x2019;ve posted videos, thousands of photos, maintained two dozen blogs, organized conf sessions, played with geotagging, 3D, virtual worlds etc And yet I find myself increasingly silent these days. Silent when confronted by the whirling outrage machine of social media. I have argued previously for the use of social media to put #archaeology where the people are online, not to build islands, but links. In 2012 @stueve &amp; I asked, &#x201C;what are you doing to participate?&#x201D; and outlined the advantages of this participation: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.2012.741810 &#x2026; @ArchaeologistSP &amp; @lshipley805 rightly pointed out that this participation was highly contingent &amp; fraught w/ abuse http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue38/perry_index.html B**xit and T**mp seemed to put the last nails in the coffin in cultivating meaningful participation &amp; creative interventions on social media Our colorful &amp; lively community (perhaps a fictive kinship) seemed diminished, the digital village disbanded and in hiding. Is there anything we can do in the face of the outrage machine? Where are the Truth &amp; Beauty Bombs of online communication in #archaeology? I&#x2019;m pleading for generative, creative, playful communication. I&#x2019;m asking, once again, for meaningful contributions to online #archaeology. Push the medium, creatively fail, comb through digital detritus for interventions to make you &amp; others think about the past, present, future If we don&#x2019;t make interventions and interfere with the perception of #archaeology why are we feeding content to this corporation? Why are we performing our outrage by tweeting links that are specifically designed to rile, punish, to profit further from political misery? I&#x2019;m not limiting dialog, demanding you to post only about #archaeology, or suppress outrage, but beware of The Nothing of endless reposts. Though you are absolutely a multiple, a collective, a fluid Strathernian dividual and political creature&#x2026;you are good at #archaeology. The #archaeology in your brain is interesting, beautiful &amp; can bring subtle color and understanding to the world. Communicate THIS. An #archaeology turgid w/ ideas, rampant w/ verve &amp; detail, an active community chewing on big (or small) ideas about humanity &amp; materiality Obviously this is happening amongst the noise! @ArchaeologyLisa was inspired by a twitter convo to contemplate: http://castlesandcoprolites.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/did-people-of-catalhoyuk-build-boats.html @ArchaeologyLisa didn&#x2019;t keep her bright new idea to herself, she didn&#x2019;t wait 5 years for publication, she pounded out a blog post &amp; shared. It doesn&#x2019;t even have to be strictly #archaeology! @rajoyceUCB ends each day with a few lines from a poem. I&#x2019;m deeply grateful for @lornarichardson hosting this twitter conference, for reclaiming this space, and I hope there are more interventions","tags":"twitter manifesto"},{"title":"en-counter-maps","url":"/2017/04/04/en-counter-maps/","text":"&#x261E; en-counter-mapsGi&#x301;sli Pa&#x301;lsson and Oscar AldredReceived 2017-04-04Citation: Pa&#x301;lsson, G., and O. Aldred. 2017 &#x201C;en-counter-maps&#x201D;. Epoiesen DOI:xxxx In the en-counter-maps project we looked at the relationships between art and archaeology through several different media. We found a common theme that was related to examining maps and their representations, and through the map we mediated our critical relationship on the processes of making and doing art and archaeology. &#xFFFC;&#xFFFC; In total we devised 4 pieces. The pieces were called Inferstructures, Maps of places called Bolungarvi&#x301;k, Threads, and A 1913 Map of 2011 Bolungarvi&#x301;k.&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC; The map is in many ways a simplification of the landscape. The multiplicity of landscape is reduced to one dimension of its visual qualities &#x2013; the god&#x2018;s eye view from above &#x2013; which is a highly subjective, disembodied representation. The intention with Infer-structures was to extend this trajectory of god&#x2018;s eye mapping to one of its consequences by reducing the map to one of its dimensions &#x2013; the road system. Furthermore we wanted to attempt to represent the experience of place when travelling through it by car, which is a representation we considered quite relevant to Bolungarvi&#x301;k as there is such a clearly defined road system through it. The piece effectively focuses on one line &#x2013; the road &#x2013; while every other lines and trajectories fade into the background. This is the experience of a town as a &#x2019;path of least involvement&#x2019;, where the only definable elements are its escape routes. The painting is naturally placed by the side of a road. We chose to use archaeological trowels to sculpt the blue background, while painting the lines with a brush. This creates a tension in the painting. We as archaeologists thought it might be appropriate to see the chaotic background as representing the material affordances of the landscape &#x2013; its archaeology &#x2013; and the lines as its histories. The lines are simple, clear, structured, but if they are not maintained and reiterated they quickly dissolve into the background. &#xFFFC; &#xFFFC;&#xFFFC; The painting later fell down into the grass, and we felt that this fit well with its wayward message. Robert Smithson once wrote that &#x201C;you cannot visit Gondwanaland, but you can visit a map of it.&#x201D; This remark was the starting point for Maps of places called Bolungarvi&#x301;k. Iceland as a place only exists on a map and its existence is entirely based on the scale which is used in making the map. That is, experiencing Iceland in its wellknown cartographic form requires the map (unless one is able to travel to outer space). All three paintings are simple representations of places called Bolungarvi&#x301;k, but so far we&#x2019;ve only discovered one place by this name. The red painting is at the scale &#x221E;:1, the white painting is at the scale 1:&#x221E;.Iceland in its cartographic form exists on a thin strip of scale somewhere in the middle. This work proved to be similarly mobile. &#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;Threads mediates the underlying tensions in our collective pieces. In this interstitial position it connects the representational pieces (Infer-structures and Maps of places called Bolungavi&#x301;k) with the fourth (1913 Map of 2011 Bolungarvi&#x301;k). As it moves back and forth being pulled but also pulling the threads that connect them, this mediation is in constant process &#x2013; in a state of becoming. Personal histories, stories about places, the rational scientific gaze and authoritative histories all intersect that set in motion new translations. &#xFFFC;A 1913 Map of 2011 Bolungarvi&#x301;k was a piece in four parts &#x2013; the construction/installation of the site/lab, a performance of the archaeological process of excavation, and the interpretation and production of archaeological artefacts and bodies of knowledge after the excavation had been completed. The last part occured on the day after the excavation when we performed the &#x2018;closing&#x2019; of the site, by incavating into the trenches many of the objects we had found and used during the process. However, a further part became apparent as we closed the trenches, as the pale grass emphasised the location of this &#x2018;happening&#x2019;. Furthermore, the trenches were still visible long after the performance had ended. The incavated objects continue to change under the surface, and may perhaps one day be excavated by a group of bored archaeologists, curious artists or perhaps a mixture of both. Central to this piece were two maps: 1913 and present-day. The residual features in the present-day map of the 1913 map provided the archaeological spatial dimension for our performed interventions: the trench locations, the act of digging, creating an archive of the excavation, and the then the incavation and closing of the site. The process resulted in a radical transformation of the area infront of the exhibition house &#x2013; and partially extended into the exhibition space - From an area of land, to the site of an excavation, to its textured interpretation on the surface &#x2013; as land art &#x2013; and finally back again to an area of land. Through the archaeological process as a performance we draw attention to our practice and the spectral absence that we bring presence to and what we have put back into the land through our spatial and temporal transformations.&#xFFFC; A 1913 map of 2011 Bolungarvi&#x301;k reflects on the critical relationship that the other pieces the pieces were suggesting about the relationship between representation and the nature of intervention, whether artistic or archaeological. In fact, what we hoped to achieve was a performance that was both neither of these things - simply a process of doing something - but at the same time could be called both art and archaeology. In the both respects we were quite successful. The process orientation was used to examine the trope of repetitive action and performance, and the representation/intervention examination achieved a conversation or dialogue between art and archaeology by blurring the boundaries between them and creating something that was unique &#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;On the opening day of &#xC6;ringur One month later Two months later &#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC; We were delighted that we could display all of our pieces outside the gallery, both on the outer walls of the house as well as on the lawn next to it, since it gave us the opportunity to further reflect on the archaeological nature of our pieces. Left exposed, the taphonomic degradation of the pieces &#x2013; both the visible and those we had incavated &#x2013; became an integral part of en-counter-maps. As the house used for &#xC6;ringur 2011 was an abandoned and condemned house, we also wanted to point out the irony between an old house that was being torn down and the excavation and decay of archaeology/art by showing how the impression of objects are not limited to the surface but is also much deeper, below the skin of the object, in its history and personal connections or threads.&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;The pieces continue to be transformed by taphonomic processes. During a recent visit we discovered that many of the objects we had used during the excavation had become mobile, exploring the territories outside the excavation area.","tags":"art"},{"title":"This site is a testing ground","url":"/2016/11/06/Epoiesen-A-Journal-of-Creativity/","text":"Contents: Lorem Ipsum More Lorem Ipsum nb this site is not the final home of the journal, but rather a testing ground as we work out the kinks in our workflow and technology &#x261E; Lorem IpsumLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
