The texture. Like the marks of a painter&#x2019;s trowel.<br><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/51/2f/62/512f62fcfbc08e1f65df04e58e0029d0--the-joy-of-painting-bob-ross-paintings.jpg" alt=""><br><br> <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jerrypatton/painting-shows/" target="_blank" rel="external">Painting Shows Pinterest: Bob Ross</a><br><br> Does the original purpose of the trowel change things materially? I feel that it does in this instance for the humans involved. The repurposing of tools from their profession within the context of this artistic expression is meaningful. From the point of view of the trowel, maybe not as much. </div><br>&#x2014;<br><div style="margin-left:0px; margin-top:20px"><span class="user"><a target="_user" href=" http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=user&amp;search=adlangmead">adlangmead</a></span> <span class="timestamp">7/25/2017 4:13:01 PM</span><span style="font-size:smaller"><a title="permalink" target="_new" href="https://hyp.is/3QyHanCTEee4th_OZx5OzA"> # </a></span><div class="annotation-quote"> archaeological trowels to sculpt the blue background</div> Upon finding myself here, oh, how I wish I could see the surface of this painting.

Archaeological layers move from top to bottom, from the present to the past, as we are doing here.<br><br> The chalk lines are now just in a state of becoming. A human appears. The technology used to create the patterns we now expect become visible. The human appears almost as an interlper, as the objects have as yet taken center stage in this system.<br><br> In the second image of this sequence, the human becomes a mere shadow. A shadow whose originating object, for a while, eluded me. The shadow of the photographer that is made on the roof melds with the shadow of the white structure on the ground to create the impression a panoptic prison tower has been inserted into our narrative. Angles are seen, all jutting out, allowing for a sweeping view of the terrain.<br><img src="http://www.folsomprisonmuseum.org/now/T-03.jpg" alt=""><br><br> <a href="http://www.folsomprisonmuseum.org/now/now22j.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Folson Prison Museum</a><br><br> It is a prison guard&#x2019;s point of view, but it is also a cartographer&#x2019;s. The question of scale both in the form of a silhouette and in the form of an inquirer&#x2019;s standpoint arises.<br><br> By the end of this sequence, distant crowds gather and time speeds on (backwards or forwards, we do not know) in a time-lapse photograph taken&#x2013;we assume&#x2013;within the white structure?<br><br> Later, I return to this time-lapse image, thinking&#x2026;&#x201D;The white structure is condemned.&#x201D; </div><br>&#x2014;<br><div style="margin-left:0px; margin-top:20px"><span class="user"><a target="_user" href=" http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=user&amp;search=adlangmead">adlangmead</a></span> <span class="timestamp">7/25/2017 3:08:41 PM</span><span style="font-size:smaller"><a title="permalink" target="_new" href="https://hyp.is/ZpLUdHFAEeeq7humVClQmQ"> # </a></span><div class="annotation-quote">In total we devised 4 pieces.</div> In the second image of this introductory sequence&#x2013;the flow of the text has defined the images&#x2019; sequentiality&#x2013;we have clearly moved back in time. The trenches are gone, the walls of the white structure are emptier, the working clutter at right is neater. Entropy (?) has been reversed. I find myself wondering if clutter is always a sign of the ravages of time. In archaeology, does mess suggest progress?<br><br> It becomes clear to me through this step back that the canvas of the white structure&#x2019;s walls are in a state of becoming.<br><br> Instead of the brown gashes of the trenches, chalk scores the earth the way that old police dramas demarcated dead bodies.<br><img src="http://ferdyonfilms.com/Man%20Must%20Die.jpg" alt=""><br> <a href="http://www.ferdyonfilms.com/date/2009/06/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ferdy on Films</a> </div><br> &#x2014;<br> <div style="margin-left:0px; margin-top:20px"><span class="user"><a target="_user" href=" http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=user&amp;search=adlangmead">adlangmead</a></span> <span class="timestamp">7/25/2017 3:08:16 PM</span><span style="font-size:smaller"><a title="permalink" target="_new" href="https://hyp.is/M5xL2HE5EeeHTTt0k3wdTg"> # </a></span><div class="annotation-quote">processes of making and doing art and archaeology.</div> A neatly-dug trench enters like a sharp brown cut up through the grass from the bottom of the frame, its line moving the eye directly  towards a white house-like structure that asks a question in a language foreign to me. The tilt of the hill and the framing of the photograph gives the structure a sense of being a sloping funhouse, an environment in which your senses are made to trick themselves, to expect level ground where there is an incline, to see solid walls dissolve unexpectedly. An experience of disorientation. Where am I?<br><br> Hvar erum vi&#xF0;? Where are we, indeed? By these words, ambiguity slides from the text into the very makeup of the landscape represented by this photograph. A quick trip to Google Translate helps me find a bit of purchase on what I am seeing, and situates this piece textually in Iceland&#x2013;something suggested, but not strictly disambiguated, by the header image.<br><br> Returning here, having finished the piece, I find that this image encapsulates for me the entirety of the story that is to come&#x2013;the inverse of ambiguity. </div><br>&#x2014;<br><div style="margin-left:0px; margin-top:20px"><span class="user"><a target="_user" href=" http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=user&amp;search=adlangmead">adlangmead</a></span> <span class="timestamp">7/25/2017 3:04:37 PM</span><span style="font-size:smaller"><a title="permalink" target="_new" href="https://hyp.is/eTFGXHE1Eee0scOms1W1xw"> # </a></span><div class="annotation-quote">en-counter-maps</div> I would like to annotate my experience of this piece by honing in on two themes: ambiguity and scale. </div>
